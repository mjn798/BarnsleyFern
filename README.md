# Visualization of the Barnsley Fern Fractal

See [Barnsley fern - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern) for more information.

The Fern starts with a vector coordinate at (0, 0) which is iterated through a transformation matrix in a loop. Each new point will be a point describing the fern and is rendered as a pixel on the canvas.
